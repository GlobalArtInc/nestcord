```typescript title="src/app.service.ts"
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Client, ChannelManager, GuildManager, UserManager, ShardClientUtil, ClientVoiceManager, WebSocketManager, REST } from 'discord.js';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
    public constructor(
        private readonly client: Client,
        private readonly channels: ChannelManager,
        private readonly guilds: GuildManager,
        private readonly users: UserManager,
        private readonly shard: ShardClientUtil,
        private readonly voice: ClientVoiceManager,
        private readonly ws: WebSocketManager,
        private readonly rest: REST
    ) {}
}
```
