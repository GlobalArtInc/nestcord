# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the nestcord codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
reduces friction contributing to this project.

## Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 16+**, and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository. Make sure you're up-to-date with the **master** branch!
2. Install the dependencies using `npm ci`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `npm lint` to run ESLint and ensure changes respect our styleguide
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/GlobalArtInc/nestcord/compare)

A high level overview of tools used:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for code-style
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
